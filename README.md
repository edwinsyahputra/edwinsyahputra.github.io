## ðŸš€ About Me
Armed with 5 years of experience as IT Support and I really like programming, so now I decided to switch careers and focus on programming, especially in the Frontend Developer position.

I have skills on SEMANTIC HTML5, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOSTRAP, SQL QUERY & GIT . Over the past year I have deepened the use of the REACT JS Framework for web development. In addition, I also just learned some of the skills needed by Backend Developers including PHP, Node JS and Laravel.

One of my goals is to become a reliable SOFTWARE DEVELOPER. If you are willing to invite me to progress and develop with your company, don't hesitate to contact me at any time through the contacts provided on my LinkedIn profile or Portfolio.
